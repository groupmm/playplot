Make Plot Playable
==================

The home for the documentation of a Python package called Make Plot Playable,
which provides the ability to create and sync multiple interactive matplotlib plots to a piece of audio.
Each plot is handled in its one process, allowing smooth animations without a blocking main thread/process.
This package works great inside interactive notebooks, with the limitations, that plots are shown on the machine
where the kernel runs.
